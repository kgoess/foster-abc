<h2>Why?</h2>
Stephen Foster is amazing.  Some of his tunes are so ubiquitous and pervasive, you don't
even realize they are songs that someone wrote, they're just part of the American cultural fabric.  On top
of that, they're beautiful.  How many things can claim to be both ubiquitous <i>and</i>
beautiful?  Coca-Cola is ubiquitous, but you wouldn't call it beautiful.  Cole Porter's songs are beautiful, but he's far from ubiquitous. Stephen Foster is both, and nobody knows who he is!

So this site was born with two goals in mind:
<ol>
    <li>To give me a Stephen Foster Fakebook.  I wanted to play some Stephen Foster tunes, I like the fakebook style, and I couldn't find any Stephen Foster in fakebook style.
    <li>To promote the knowledge, love, and acceptance of Stephen Foster in the world at large by giving everybody <i>else</i> a Stephen Foster Fakebook.
</ol>
<p>

Each one of these songs you probably already know, but you won't <i>know</i> you know until you hear it.  Some of the ones, like Old Uncle Ned, you might not know, but were once a lot more famous than they are now.  (In "Little House in the Big Woods", there's a scene where Pa takes down his fiddle and starts to play. . . "Old Uncle Ned".)
