W:The morn of life is past, 
W:And evening comes at last;
W:It brings me a dream of a once happy day,
W:Of merry forms I've seen 
W:Upon the village green,
W:Sporting with my old dog Tray.
W:Old dog Tray's ever faithful,
W:Grief cannot drive him away,
W:He's gentle, he is kind;
W:I'll never, never find
W:A better friend than old dog Tray.
W:2.
W:The forms I call'd my own
W:Have vanished one by one,
W:The lov'd ones, the dear ones have all passed away,
W:Their happy smiles have flown,
W:Their gentle voices gone;
W:I've nothing left but old dog Tray.
