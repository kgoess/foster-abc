<h2>Why?</h2>
Stephen Foster is amazing.  Some of his tunes are so ubiquitous and pervasive, you don't
even realize they are songs, they're just part of the American cultural fabric.  On top
of that, they're beautiful.  How many things can claim to be both ubiquitous <i>and</i> i
beautiful?  Coca-Cola is ubiquitous, but you wouldn't call it beautiful.  Cole Porter is 
beautiful, but he's far from ubiquitous. And nobody knows who he is!

So this site was born with two goals in mind:
<ol>
    <li>To give me a Stephen Foster Fakebook.  I wanted to play some Stephen Foster tunes, I like the fakebook style, and I couldn't find any Stephen Foster in fakebook style.
    <li>To promote the knowledge, love and acceptance of Stephen Foster in the world at large by giving everybody <i>else</i> a Stephen Foster Fakebook.
</ol>
